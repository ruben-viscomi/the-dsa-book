## Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

-   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.
