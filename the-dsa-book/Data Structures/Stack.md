The stack is a data structure used to always get access to the last inserted item. By this property the [[Stack]] a **LIFO** (Last in, first out) data structure. It's used in algorithms used by other compound data structures and internally by any machine.
Depending on the implementation, the [[Stack]] can either be stored in heap memory or in the call stack (a stack used by the operating system and present in the RAM to manage the program's runtime). However this last implementation is very uncommon, since there are more disadvantages, such as non-dynamic size (required by most of the use cases of the stack) and cluttering caused by the use of contiguous memory.
