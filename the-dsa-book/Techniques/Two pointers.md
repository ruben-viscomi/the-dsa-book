Two pointers is a technique that is generally applied to [[Array|Arrays]] and [[String|Strings]] (or mostly data structures stored in contiguous memory) in order to reduce the time complexity of algorithms related to those data structures.

It consists in taking to pointers, generally 1 at the start and the other at the end of the data structure, and to move them independently based on certain conditions.
